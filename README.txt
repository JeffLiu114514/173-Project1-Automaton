Name: Dingcheng Wang (dwang63)
Teamate: Junfei Liu(jliu137)

Run Instruction:
1. cd to the dir where these codes are
2. Run the command of "gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -o project1 *.c"
3. Run the exe file you just generated: .\project1.exe

Interestingly, we found fgets() may be troublesome, so we used scanf() instead.
In the terminal, we use 0 for false and 1 for true.

We have mainly built this program based on the provide source and header file (.c & .h) of nfa and dfa. We also used the ones for LinkedList.
